  <p>A <dfn id="def_floating_time">floating time</dfn> or a <dfn id="dfn_floating_date">floating date</dfn> is a time value that isn't tied to a specific time zone. 
     Applications have to avoid implicit conversion to <em>incremental time</em> values or the improper
     use of time zones when displaying or processing a floating time value.
  </p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="detail"><a href="#detail">Details</a></h2>
  <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/">Working with Timezones</a> WG Note says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some observed time values are not related to a specific moment in incremental time. Instead, they need to be combined with local information to determine a range of acceptable incremental time values. We refer to these sorts of time values as "floating times" because they are not fixed to a specific incremental time value. Floating times are not attached and should never be attached to a particular time zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example of a floating time value would be a publication date. Consider the <em>January 30, 2013</em>, issue of a document such as 
a newspaper, magazine, or blog posting. The publication date does not depend on the time zone of the person reading the document. Any
person reading the document should expect to see the same date as the publication date.
Such a document might describe its publication date in HTML this way: </p>
<figure class="example">
<p> &lt;p&gt;Publication Date: &lt;time datetime=&quot;2013-01-30&quot;&gt;January 30, 2013&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</figure>
  <p>This seems unambiguous. However, problems can arise if Web developers or content authors 
  do not treat the publication date as a floating time value. For example, the JavaScript <code>Date</code>
  object is a form of <em>incremental</em> time: it represents the number of milliseconds since an <span class="qterm">epoch date</span>. In the case of JavaScript, the epoch data is the same as that used by Unix, the Java programming language, and many other systems: it's defined as midnight, January 1, 1970 <strong>in the UTC time zone</strong>. </p>
  <p>The range of incremental times that describe <samp>2016-01-30</samp> turns out to span as 
  many as fifty hours. Depending on the time zone used to create and display an incremental 
  time value, the same floating date value could be as much as two days off. </p>
  <p>That's because, while a floating time is not tied to a specific time zone, any incremental time values depend on time zone for their display and processing. Since data formats for time values in both server-side (such as Java) and client-side languages (such as JavaScript) are always incremental times, this can lead to issues. For example, you can easily have code in your Web page that looks like this: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>var date = new Date(myPubDateElement.value);
var target = document.getElementById(&quot;date_target&quot;);
target.appendChild(document.createTextNode(date.toDateString()));</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>Suppose your element <code class="kw" translate="no">myPubDateElement</code> contained the value above (2013-01-30). You'd expect the element <code class="kw" translate="no">date_target</code> contain a string representing that date. However, if you live in a time zone west of UTC (for example, in the <code class="kw" translate="no">America/Los_Angeles</code> time zone), you'll get a surprise. It says: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>Tue Jan 29 2013</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>The problem here is that many of the <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> methods in JavaScript are sensitive to the local system's time zone and they try to present the value using local time zone rules. In the case of a system running in the <code class="kw" translate="no">America/Los_Angeles</code> time zone, which has an offset from UTC of either -8 hours or -7 hours (depending on whether or not daylight savings time is in effect) the value presented to the user from the JavaScript is incorrect because the the <code class="kw" translate="no">time</code> portion of the publication date is zeroed out. Subtracting eight hours from the <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> object results in a presentation string that is on the <span class="qterm">previous</span> day. That day might be in the wrong month or even the wrong year.</p>
  <p>One way to work around this it to always use UTC (there are methods in JavaScript, for example, that allow one to work strictly in UTC) for floating time values.</p>
  <h3 id="yyyshortcomings2"><a href="#yyyshortcomings">Storing, Retrieving, and Aggregating Time Data</a></h3>
  <p>Another way that floating times are used is in the aggregation of data. For example, suppose you want to track the number of downloads that a user made on a daily basis. If you journal each download, it's easy to reconstruct the list of downloads. Consider: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>{
    &quot;item&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com/downloadMe&quot;,
    &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2013-10-02T13:17:00Z&quot;
},</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>However, this might be cumbersome as the number of downloads grow. You might want to create summary statistics: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>{
    &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2013-10-02&quot;,
    &quot;numDownloaded&quot;: 10
},</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>In this particular case, you <em>do</em> want to use local time (non-floating time) to compute the value of <code class="kw" translate="no">date</code> when the user starts a download (that is, when you add information to the data). But you'll want to use a consistent (or <span class="qterm">floating</span>) frame of reference when retrieving the record. </p>
